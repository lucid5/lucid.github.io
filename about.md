I wrote something long, and lazily hide it here. It is intimate about me myself, and you yourself. Yes, *you* who is pointing to the tip of your nose. Why you? Because whoever is reading this with a bit of care is relevant.

Whatever happen next, please pardon my engrish.

Sunday morning. You wake up early, it's only 6:00AM. 

Such a delightfully odd hour to wake up, but the whispers of your mind is clear: sleep is done now, take a deep breath of fresh morning air, accept the truth. After all those years seeking for a better sleep schedule and promising yourself to start doing it, you finally did it, for the first time - by accident.

The profound secret for a better sleep, you realised, is a sudden emptiness of your fridge on saturday night, and you being too lazy to visit the grocery for more food. So you make do with a handful of mushrooms, some greens and two eggs. 

Too light a dinner it was. You decided to make it at least looked pretty. Your collective youtube cooking shows aesthetics will help.

Sleeves up, you swiftly threw a crushed clove of garlic into your sizzling hot pan, generously sprinkled salt and pepper down the smoke of caramelized mushroom, gently cracked two eggs into the mix. One broken. you mean, one scrambled, one sunny side up, for diversity.

Everything onto plate, something missing? *Vibrant colors*. There is some brightly red chilli and fresh green mini arugula left. You remember placing them nice and neatly next to the others, your preciouseseses. A symphony, you thought, of flavor and textures and colors, and smell. So you put on some Nujabes for your ears to join the fun bunch as well.

And you sit down, feeling happy.

*What is this feeling?* - you asked yourself, noticing the sudden presence of a second person.

Someone who is completely wrapped up in warm clothes, coming from afar, amidst the heavy snow, has finally arrived, standing on the porch outside of your tiny, lonely cot. The person know this is the right address, confidently calling your name and knocking on the door, of the deepest and coldest corner of your heart.

You open the door and invite the person in, who then light up the fireplace and throw in some wood to help the fire. You two sit down smelling the good food, humming to the good beat, grining silently as warmth and light kept radiating from the simmering new fire.

*That's right!*, the kind of happiness that simmers effortlessly, lowkey but is here to stay. Not that kind of fleeting pleasures, no rushed release of hormones stimulated by skills you have mastered since puberty. Not the taste of sugary food. Definitely not that time when you score better than your friends in class or in life. Not the likes and congrats Facebook people send obligatorily on your shiny new job, clothes, relationship, millionth picture carefully crafted artsy - not any new token on the validation rat race.

You remember the firekeeper told you the wisest things in the whole wide world, all the while tapping feet to your soulful jazzy music as the youtube playlist rolls on. *♪ I have seen the sparrow get high, but he ain't freer than you. Dont let space and time confuse ya, don't let name and form abuse ya!♫*.

Before you know it, your feet was slowly tapping too. Cold carpet underground. Darkness retreat to the corner of the room. Sunday morning light slowly creeping through the aluminium shades, sitting shy on the window sill. You hear yourself breath peacefully, air pressure vibrates in accordance. You smell the delicious spice lingering from last night kitchen work. There is probably birds tweeting somewhere. Water drops from the roof become miraculously melodic. Your small plant pot seems to be singing something. You are euphoric, sipping the sweet moment down to the bottom of your soul.

Who cares? Nobody.

Nobody cares that you are having the time of your life. That this, and last night's mediocre joyful moments are more real than anything they ever know about you. You are to them, essentially, just another boring spark of life whose existence is shorter than one moment of their universe getting distracted. 

The world is too crowded of such dim sparks. Everyone squeeze themselves in an allocated tiny little space on that fast scrolling electronic newsfeed, screaming for attention by the catchiest visual cues. Algorithms jump into the help. Highlight that *congrats*, play the notification tune, red must be on blue, send out reminders that happy birth day message is just one click away, color your avatar to show sympathy and join you to the sympathetic community. People feel loved, cared, and not alone for a short moment. 

Then Algorithms say it is time for the next one, go craft it or you lose.

But you don't care about the others as well. Upon this realization, you leave your phone on the desk, black mirror faced down. You stand up next to the window and think.
