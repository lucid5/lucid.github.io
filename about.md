I wrote something long, and lazily hide it here. It is intimate about me myself, and you yourself. Yes, *you* who is pointing to the tip of your nose. Why you? Because whoever is reading this with a bit of care is relevant.

Whatever happen next, please pardon my engrish.

Sunday morning. You wake up early, it's only 6:00AM. 

Such a delightfully odd hour to wake up, but the whispers of your mind is clear: sleep is done now, take a deep breath, accept the truth. After all those years seeking for a better sleep schedule and promising yourself to start doing it, you finally did it - by accident.

The profound secret for a better sleep, you realised, is a sudden emptiness of your fridge on saturday night, and you being too lazy to visit the grocery for more food. So you make do with a handful of mushrooms, some greens and two eggs. 

Too light a dinner it was. You decided to make it at least looked pretty. Your collective youtube cooking shows aesthetics will help.

Sleeves up, you swiftly threw a crushed clove of garlic into your sizzling hot pan, generously sprinkled salt and pepper down the smoke of caramelized mushroom, gently cracked two eggs into the mix. One broken. you mean, one scrambled, one sunny side up, for diversity.

Everything onto plate, something missing? *Vibrant colors*. There is some brightly red chilli and fresh green mini-arugula left. You remember placing them nice and neatly next to the others, your precious. A symphony, you thought, of flavor, textures, colors, and smell. So you put on some Nujabes for your ears to join the fun bunch as well.

And you sit down, feeling happy. 

**

*What is this feeling?* - you asked yourself, noticing the sudden presence of a second person.

Someone who is completely wrapped up in warm clothes, coming from afar, amidst the heavy snow, has finally arrived. The person is standing outside on the porch of your tiny, lonely shelter. An acquaintance, who know the right address, calling your name and knocking on the door. The door of the deepest and coldest corner of your heart.

You invite the person in, who then light up the fireplace and throw in some wood to help the fire. You two sit down smelling the good food, humming to the good beat, grining silently as warmth and light kept radiating from the simmering new fire.

*This is it!*, the kind of happiness that is effortless, ever-glowing, crackling like small fire, but full of promises to stay around for good. Not the kind of fleeting pleasures, no rushed release of hormones stimulated by skills you have mast*u*red since puberty. Not the taste of sugary food. Definitely not that time when you score better than your friends in class or in life. Not the likes Facebook people are sending obligatorily to your shiny new job, clothes, relationship, millionth picture carefully crafted artsy - not any new token on the validation rat race.

You remember that the acquaintance, a firekeeper, told you the wisest things in the whole wide world, all the while tapping feet to your soulful jazzy music as the youtube playlist rolls on. *♪ I have seen the sparrow get high, but he ain't freer than you. Dont let space and time confuse ya, don't let names and forms abuse ya!♫*.

Before you know it, your feet was slowly tapping too. Cold fuzzy carpet underneath. Darkness retreat to the corner of the room. Sunday morning light slowly creeping through the aluminium shades, sitting shy on the windowsill. You hear your peaceful breath, clear, in and out, stretching air pressure vibrates in accordance. You smell the delicious spice lingering from last night kitchenwork. There are probably birds tweeting somewhere. Water drops from the roof become miraculously melodic. The silhouette of your small plant pot seems to be singing something. You are euphoric, sipping and savouring the sweet moment down to the bottom of your soul.

Who cares? Nobody. I'm glad you notice.

Nobody cares that you are having the time of your life. That this, and last night's mediocre joyful reunion in the shelter are more real than anything they ever know about you. Pic or didnt happen. You are to them, essentially, just another boring spark of life whose existence is shorter than one moment of their universe getting distracted. 

The world is too crowded of such dim sparks. Everyone squeeze themselves in an allocated tiny little space, on that fast scrolling electronic newsfeed, screaming for attention by the catchiest visual cues. Algorithms jump into the help. Highlight that *congrats*, play the notification tune, red must be on blue, send out reminders that your friend happiest birthday is just one mechanical click away, join you to the sympathetic community of three shades colored avatars. 

Algorithms know people are scared of reaching out, touching, making an effort to do conversations, smile, hug, sending letters. So they do it for them. Automated human interaction, why not? the thing is profitable. People signed a contract to lend out their vague emotions and presence to an artificial space, which got manifested to the extent that actually make some other people feel important, loved, and not alone for a short moment.

Too dramatic and pessimistic, you thought. But connecting people is an overcooked mission now anyway, you added. Also, you don't care about the other people as much. Upon this realization, you leave your phone on the desk, black mirror faced down. Torn from your morning routine of facebook, quora, twitter sessions on the toilet, you stand up next to the window, look beyond the silent construction site.

There is a pretty sakura tree, blooming its violet little flowers, blending in and out to the early sky's color. 

A tree cannot move, it cannot scream for attention. People like you who are indifferent about trees closed the window shades and drifted their mind away. Both leaving each other alone. But then there are always people who love sakura that gather around and admire. The tree keeps on sprouting nevertheless, because it's spring, not because of the admirers. 

You sit down, understand that it is time to walk out of the crowded, noisy and monotone forest, find a construction site, and plant your own sakura thingy.
